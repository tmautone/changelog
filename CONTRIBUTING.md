Hi there,

Please open a pull request with any suggestions you have regarding the
example [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) or the [README](README.md).


Don't edit the [`index.html`](index.html) manually. Instead:

1. make changes to [README](README.md) if necessary
2. run [`generate.thor`](generate.thor) with `thor generate index`.
3. add the `README.md` and `index.html` changes to a Pull Request.

Tweaks, fixes and improvements to any of the [assets](assets/) are also
quite welcome.
